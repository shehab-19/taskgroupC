# Migration Plan: AWS to Azure Cloud Platform

## 1. Infrastructure Replication Strategy

### a. Identify the Existing Infrastructure:
- Document all resources in AWS, including EC2 instances, databases, S3 storage (for images/PDFs), load balancers, and networking configurations (VPC, subnets, security groups).
- List the software dependencies and versions used in the applications.

### b. Choose the Corresponding Services in Azure:
- Identify the corresponding services in Azure.
  - AWS EC2 -> Azure Virtual Machines (VMs)
  - AWS RDS -> Azure SQL Database or Azure Database for MySQL/PostgreSQL
  - AWS S3 -> Azure Blob Storage
  - AWS Elastic Load Balancers -> Azure Load Balancers

### c. Automate the Infrastructure Replication:
- Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like **Terraform** or **Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates** to create the infrastructure in Azure.
  - Define Virtual Network (VNet), subnets, network security groups, and other networking components.
  - Deploy Virtual Machines (VMs) with the same configuration.
  - Set up load balancers, storage, and DNS records in Azure.

## 2. Database Migration Plan

### a. Assess Database Type:
- Identify the database type in AWS (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server).
- Choose the corresponding Azure service (e.g., Azure SQL Database, Azure Database for MySQL/PostgreSQL).

### b. Minimal Downtime Database Migration:
- **Option 1: Database Replication:**
  - Use **Azure Database Migration Service (DMS)** to replicate the database from AWS RDS to the corresponding Azure service with minimal downtime.
- **Option 2: Backup and Restore:**
  - Take a full backup of the AWS database and restore it on Azure.
  - Perform incremental updates after the initial backup to minimize downtime.

### c. Test Database Integrity:
- Verify the migrated data by comparing checksums or using validation queries.
- Test application connectivity to ensure there are no issues with the new Azure database.

## 3. Application Assets Migration (Images, PDFs, etc.)

### a. Migrate S3 Data to Azure Blob Storage:
- Use cloud-native tools like **Azure Storage Migration Service** or third-party tools (e.g., **Rclone**) to move assets from AWS S3 to Azure Blob Storage.
- Ensure proper permissions and access control are replicated for the new Blob Storage containers.

### b. Sync During Cutover:
- Set up a synchronization job using **Rclone** or similar tools to continuously sync any new/modified files in AWS S3 to Azure Blob Storage, ensuring minimal data loss during the final cutover.

## 4. Application Migration and Configuration

### a. Prepare Application Deployments:
- Deploy the application components (frontend, backend) in Azure.
- Ensure configurations such as environment variables, connection strings, and secrets are correctly set up in Azure.

### b. Test the Applications:
- Run functional and performance tests on the replicated infrastructure in Azure.
- Verify that the application can connect to the newly migrated database and assets (images/PDFs).

## 5. DNS and Final Cutover

### a. Schedule a Maintenance Window:
- Inform stakeholders of the maintenance window and expected downtime (if any).

### b. Final Database and Assets Sync:
- Perform a final sync of the database and assets just before the cutover.

### c. DNS Switch:
- Update the DNS records to point to the new Azure infrastructure.
- Ensure a short TTL (Time to Live) for DNS propagation.

### d. Monitor and Validate:
- Monitor the application and infrastructure closely post-cutover to ensure stability.
- Have a rollback plan in place in case of unexpected issues.

## 6. Post-Migration Tasks

### a. Decommission Old AWS Resources:
- After confirming the success of the migration, decommission the AWS resources to avoid unnecessary costs.

### b. Cost Optimization and Scaling:
- Review the new Azure setup for any cost optimization opportunities (e.g., auto-scaling, instance types, storage tiers).
- Implement auto-scaling based on demand to ensure the application handles traffic efficiently.

---

**Key Considerations:**
- **Minimal Downtime Approach:** Database replication or incremental sync ensures minimal downtime for the application.
- **Automating Infrastructure Deployment:** Using Terraform or ARM templates will speed up the process and reduce the chances of manual errors.
- **Testing:** Ensure thorough testing in the new environment to validate functionality and performance.
